#### Our project for the Internet Of Things subject.
#### Main coder: Grimaru (I'm also the one who built the model myself from the beginning when it was just a crappy sensor on a breadboard as well as upgraded it to a car. Shout out to my older brother for staying up late to help me build the car frame)
#### Email: rinnenguyenlife4u@gmail.com (sub: 22dh112315@st.huflit.edu.vn)
#### Actually, I did save all the sources of the code (including fail processing files). But unfortunately, during the time of volume balancing in my drive (C and E), I accidentally pressed shift + delete the IOT.rar so it lost. However, my friend (who did the report) did share the link for us to do together and I put everything in it already so I managed to save (almost) the full original file. (No .ino file here but in the report, there will be code in it and you just copy + paste into the file in Arduino app). In the future, I will add the controlling app (I did it in AppInventor)
#### Here are photos of MIT App Inventor for the controlling app.
